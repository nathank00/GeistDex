# GeistDex Progress Log

**Public GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/nathank00/GeistDex](https://github.com/nathank00/GeistDex)

## **Current Status**  
- DEX Liquidity Extraction: Successfully fetching liquidity reserves from Uniswap.  
- Historical Liquidity Tracking: Storing reserve data in SQLite for pattern detection.  

---

## **Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)**  

### **DEX Integration**  
- Connected to Ethereum using Alchemy.  
- Implemented Uniswap liquidity extraction via `client.CallContract()`.  
- Stored liquidity history in SQLite for real-time tracking.  

---

## **Phase 2: Arbitrage Scanner (In Progress)**  

### **Next Steps**  
- Expand liquidity fetching: Add SushiSwap, Balancer, and Curve.  
- Implement cross-DEX price comparison: Compare token prices across Uniswap and SushiSwap.  
- Identify arbitrage opportunities: Detect profitable trades based on slippage and liquidity shifts.  
- Store price data in a `prices` table for historical analysis.

## **Phase 3: Trade Execution (Planned)**  

- Optimize gas costs and trade execution.  
- Flashbots integration for MEV protection.  
- Automate arbitrage trades based on pre-set thresholds.  

---

## **Notes and Decisions**  
- Switched to raw smart contract calls (`client.CallContract()`) instead of `bind.NewBoundContract` for better stability.  
- Using SQLite for now but will transition to PostgreSQL for scalability.  
- All major progress is logged here to ensure continuity across sessions.
